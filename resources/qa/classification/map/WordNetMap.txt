# LOCATION	
	
*** The choice of the categories for LOCATION seems to be arbitrary. For example, one could/might question why is there
a category for MOUNTAIN, but not one for RIVER. To solve this, we further extend the location category, by
adding more fine grained subcategories, in order to try to cover other locations which we consider important,
and can amend the task of entity extraction.
	
LOCATION:CITY
# S: (n) urban area, populated area (a geographical area constituting a city or town) 
Example hyponyms: [municipality], city, town, national capital, capital of Portugal, Lisbon, Porto.
Review: It's not too generic, despite the name. The next hypernym is 'geographical area', which is of course very wide in scope.	
	common_synsets('city', 'town', 'municipality', 'capital of Portugal') all point to 'urban area'.
	However, it could also introduce some 'towns' which are not present in a 'gazetteer' of cities.
	Additionally (and probably the most important), in 'urban area', only the synset 'municipality' has hyponyms. 
	The others are 'megalopolis', 'new town', 'barrio', 'Rustbelt', 'Twin Cities'.
	There is also S: (n) residential district, residential area, community (a district where people live; occupied primarily by private residences),
	which includes 'suburb', but they are not exactly cities, and they'll eventually map into the synset 'location', and to
	the category LOCATION:OTHER.
