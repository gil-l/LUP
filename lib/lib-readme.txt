This folder contains jar files of libraries used in the question-classification task:

===============
berkeley-parser (version 1.1)
===============

"Our work has focused on learning probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) which
assign a sequence of words the most likely parse tree. The parser supports a variety
of languages and achieves state-of-the-art performance on most of them. For additional
information and related projects visit the Berkeley NLP website."

commons-logging (version 1.1.1)
===============

The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging implementations.
A library that uses the commons-logging API can be used with any logging implementation at runtime.
Commons-logging comes with support for a number of popular logging implementations,
and writing adapters for others is a reasonably simple task.
